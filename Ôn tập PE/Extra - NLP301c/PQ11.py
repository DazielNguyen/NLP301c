# Question 11: (3 marks)
# Write a program to find all palindrome words in a text (case-insensitive).
# A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
# Return unique palindromes in lowercase, sorted alphabetically.

# Input:
# "Mom and Dad saw a racecar at noon. The kayak was level on the water."

# Desired Output:
# ['dad', 'kayak', 'level', 'mom', 'noon', 'racecar']

def process(text: str) -> list:
    # TODO: Implement your solution here
    pass

    text = "Mom and Dad saw a racecar at noon. The kayak was level on the water."
    print(process(text))
